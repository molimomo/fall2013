Programming Assignment 3

===Description===
This program implements the sliding window protocol by transferring a
file 100KB or less from a client to a server despite possible packet loss.
It does this by implementing sliding windows at both client and the server
with packet timeouts when the client does not receive an ack from the server.
The server will discard packets which are out of the range of its sliding 
window and will also buffer packets that are out of order.

===Compilation===
To compile the program simply run make in the working directory with
GBNclient.c and GBNserver.c 

===Usage===
After compliation two executable can be run with the usage:
$ ./GBNclient <server_ip> <server_port> <error rate> <random seed> <send_file> <send_log> 
$ ./GBNserver <server_port> <error rate> <random seed> <send_file> <send_log>

===Implementation Details===
The client first reads the file into a large buffer and then reads from 
that buffer into a 1024 KB payload. A header is then attached that contains
a 3 byte sequence number, a 4 byte payload size, and a 1 byte final packet flag.
(For a total of 1033KB packets) These packets are sent to the server using
the sliding window protocol, the server reads these packets into another
large buffer and then writes to it to file once the last packet is received.
The server sends an ack back of 6 bytes, a 3 byte seq number, and a 3 byte
cum ack  number. If the final ack is lost on transmission the client only
retransmits 10 times before closing.
