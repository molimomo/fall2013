Programming Assignment 3

USAGE: "./routed_LS <RouterID> <LogFileName> <Initialization file>"

DESCRIPTION: This program implements a simple version of OSPF Link State routing.
Several linux processes connect through ports and simulate routers. Once connected
the routers begin sharing Link State Packets to learn about the topology of the network.
Djikstras is then used to find the shortest path between any two routers.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: 
-Exiting succesfully.
-Logging the correct information.

WHAT DOES WORK:
-Routers succesfully connect to all other routers and initalize correctly.
-Once connected routers flood LSP to all other routers in the network.
-The internal routing table is correctly populated.
-Djikstras finds the shortest path on the routing table.
